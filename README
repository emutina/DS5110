The primary objective of this research is to determine a subset of the 64 item EPSi that represent 
underlying constructs deduced by variable response patterns to facilitate efficient screening at primary 
care visits. To accomplish this objective we implement exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and
utilize clustering methods to identify which questions have the highest impact of the individual scoring 
positive for psychosis. 

There are 4 python files each with independent purposes: 

File_1of4_data_prep.py
The purpose of this file is demonstrate how the data was cleaned. NaN values were replaced with participant
responses from a different time point. The dataframe that results from this file was used through the 
remaining analysis.

***Required Libraries to Run File 1***
- pandas
- numpy 

File_2of4_cleaning_EFA_withCFA_models.py
The purpose of this file is to complete the factor analysis(FA). First, it checks if the data is a good 
fit for further anaylsis. If the data can be used for FA it checks which factor the data loads to (factors
decided based on a scree plot), and removes cross and low loading variables if applicable. It will 
ultimately produce a clean factor model. 

***Required Libraries to Run File 2***
- pandas
- factor_analyzer - for KMO, Bartlett's test, and factor analysis
- matplotlib
- semopy - for Stuctural Equation Modeling 

File_3of4_clustering_means&DBSCAN.py
The purpose of this file is to run the three clustering algorithms(fuzzy clustering, DBSCAN, & GMM)
and provide visualizations for the models.  

***Required Libraries to Run File 3***
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-fuzzy - for fuzzy clustering logic
- scikit-learn - for preprocessing and PCA

File_4of4_heatmaps&visuals.py
The purpose of this code is to generate the visuals utalized throughout the report for loading the 
factors. 

***Required Libraries to Run File 4***
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib 
- seaborn
